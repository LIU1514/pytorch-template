# PyTorch Project Template

## Guidelines

- Take care of the matrix dimensions, axis and datatypes (Pytorch typecast is different from Numpy). 
- Take care of variable referencing (whether its by value or by address).
- Use assert() and keepdim options.
- List all non-trivial options of any library function even if they take default values for clarity. For self-defined classes and functions, use default values in function definition if they will be mostly constant, so that no parameters are needed to pass when calling them.
- Use space after comma in function parameters for clarity but not in tuples
